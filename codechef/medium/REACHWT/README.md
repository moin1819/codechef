## Problem

### Reach Weight

You need to buy some weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

You can buy either $1$ kg weights for $20$ rupees, or $2$ kg weights for $30$ rupees.

Find the minimum cost to buy such a set of weights that sum to $N$ kg.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum total cost of buying a set of weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();

            int cost = (N / 2) * 30;

            if (N % 2 != 0) {
                cost += 20;
            }

            System.out.println(cost);
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
