# Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  array of  **distinct**  integers `nums`.

There is an element in `nums` that has the  **lowest**  value and an element that has the  **highest**  value. We call them the  **minimum**  and  **maximum**  respectively. Your goal is to remove  **both**  these elements from the array.

A  **deletion**  is defined as either removing an element from the  **front**  of the array or removing an element from the  **back**  of the array.

Return  *the  **minimum**  number of deletions it would take to remove  **both**  the minimum and maximum element from the array.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [101]
Output: 1
Explanation:  
There is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.
We can remove it with 1 deletion.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
- The integers in nums are distinct.

class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }

        int minIdx = 0;
        int maxIdx = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIdx]) {
                minIdx = i;
            }
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIdx]) {
                maxIdx = i;
            }
        }

        int a = Math.min(minIdx, maxIdx);
        int b = Math.max(minIdx, maxIdx);
        int op1 = b + 1;
        int op2 = n - a;
        int op3 = (a + 1) + (n - b);

        return Math.min(op1, Math.min(op2, op3));
    }
}
```
